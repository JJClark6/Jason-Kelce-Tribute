            <h1 class="title-JK">About The Eagles' Legend</h1>

            <p>Jason Kelce was born on November 5th, 1987, in Westlake, Ohio. He attended
                Cleveland Heights High School where he played both linebacker and running back. 
                He later switched to offensive line after redshirting his initial year at Cincinnati<br><br>

                Jason was taken in the 6th round of the 2011 draft by the Philidelphia Eagles. He signed a four year 
                rookie contract and became the starting center. Kelce had an outsnading 2013 season where he started
                all 16 games and helped the eagles make the playoffs.<br><br>

                From here Kelce kept improving and eventually came one of the best centers in the league
                year in and year out. <br><br>

                Jason Kelce seems to have an endless list of accolades: 7 time Pro Bowler, 5 time First Team
                All Pro, Superbowl Champion. And most of all he captured the hearts of Philly fans all over the world. <br><br><br>
